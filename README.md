# HDMI to DisplayPort converter reverse engineering

Back around 2015/2016 I bought a Belfan HDMI to DisplayPort converter
("EA-HCHD"). Around October of 2016 I decided to take it apart and see
how it worked. My notes on this are in [Notes.md](Notes.md). I've also
included my device's [bootlog](bootlog.txt) and a
[serial port setup script](serial_setup.sh) to help with connecting to
the device's internal serial port.
